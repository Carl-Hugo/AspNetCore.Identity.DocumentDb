# AspNetCore.Identity.DocumentDb

A DocumentDB Storage Provider for ASP.NET Core Identity

Now that a preview of the .NET Core SDK for DocumentDB is available, I started with this custom
storage provider for ASP.NET Core Identity.

~~Only the initial project setup is done so far - more soon!~~

Implementation of UserStore and RoleStore is now complete and the provider should be fully functional.
I will update the documentation soon - until then, check out the sample project in the `/Samples` folder
